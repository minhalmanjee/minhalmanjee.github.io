üë©üèª‚Äçüíª I am recent graduate with a major in Computer Science from FAST NUCES.
<br>
üíª As a Software Engineer, I bring expertise in building AI-driven applications, ranging from applying machine learning models & visualizations to developing Computer Vision systems (YOLOv8, Roboflow). I combine this with strong experience in Cloud Computing and CI/CD pipelines (Git, Azure, Azure DevOps, AWS). With a solid foundation in data science and machine learning, I can apply models to extract insights, optimize processes, and bridging the gap between technical innovation and business understanding.
<br>
üìò Relevant Coursework
Completed advanced coursework in Software Engineering & Agile Practices, gaining practical experience with Agile and traditional models (Waterfall, Spiral, Prototype), requirement engineering, project planning with Azure, software architecture, and quality assurance/testing. Studied Fundamentals of Management, focusing on planning, organizing, leading, and balancing efficiency with effectiveness in organizational performance. Strengthened skills in Software Analysis & Design (UML & OOP Modeling) by conducting domain analysis, creating UML diagrams, and translating business needs into technical specifications.
<br>
üë©‚Äçüè´ As a Tech Trainer, I have trained international students as a Section Leader at Stanford Code In Place.

# Highlights
In the year 2024, I was selected as as a [Section Leader](https://digitalcredential.stanford.edu/check/FD5D425C196C656CC24C6D5991A113B553F4D0063B561E9963744C6D70AED9C4Y2cxK2hNdkpVYkVLZ3BGMkJMYXM0UlYwdGdxSm4vbnh3ZmZnOEp5QWxUbHlwWGMv) at [Stanford's Code in Place](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/) 
<br>
I secured a 7.5 band score overall in my IELTS English Proficiency Exam.
<br>
I was [featured](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fast-nuces-karachi_fastnuces-congratulations-stanforduniversity-activity-7204077987279839232-In4T) across university media pages as the sole student selected as a Section Leader for Code In Place 2024.
<br>
I have participated in multiple AI International Hackathons, particularly:
 > [Falcon AI71 Hackathon 2024](https://lablab.ai/u/@M4xash/cm0gxv92s00ac8ztm2gwf0z0a), where I developed a real-time mental health coach application in collaboration with      an international team utilizing AI71 Hub Model to support multiple personalities.
<br>
 > [Llama 3 Hackathon](https://lablab.ai/u/@M4xash/cm0fgv76z004o7hkwcdcv0zte), where I collaborated to build an AI news analyzer with two agents, News Editor and News           Analyst, to identify and improve content readability.
