üë©üèª‚Äçüíª I am a Graduate Research Assistant at University of Wyoming, with experience designing and delivering AI-powered applications that combine machine learning, computer vision (YOLOv8, Roboflow), and cloud-native solutions (Azure, AWS, Git, DevOps). I specialize in turning complex data into actionable insights, optimizing processes, and building scalable, user-focused systems that bridge technical innovation with business impact. Previously, I also trained international students as a Section Leader at Stanford Code In Place, strengthening my ability to communicate complex concepts and mentor effectively.

# Highlights
In the year 2024, I was selected as as a [Section Leader](https://digitalcredential.stanford.edu/check/FD5D425C196C656CC24C6D5991A113B553F4D0063B561E9963744C6D70AED9C4Y2cxK2hNdkpVYkVLZ3BGMkJMYXM0UlYwdGdxSm4vbnh3ZmZnOEp5QWxUbHlwWGMv) at [Stanford's Code in Place](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/) 
<br>
I secured a 7.5 band score overall in my IELTS English Proficiency Exam.

I was [featured](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fast-nuces-karachi_fastnuces-congratulations-stanforduniversity-activity-7204077987279839232-In4T) across university media pages as the sole student selected as a Section Leader for Code In Place 2024.
<br>
I have participated in multiple AI International Hackathons, particularly:
 > [Falcon AI71 Hackathon 2024](https://lablab.ai/u/@M4xash/cm0gxv92s00ac8ztm2gwf0z0a), where I developed a real-time mental health coach application in collaboration with      an international team utilizing AI71 Hub Model to support multiple personalities.
<br>
 > [Llama 3 Hackathon](https://lablab.ai/u/@M4xash/cm0fgv76z004o7hkwcdcv0zte), where I collaborated to build an AI news analyzer with two agents, News Editor and News           Analyst, to identify and improve content readability.
