Hackathon Projects - LabLab.ai
======
* Falcon AI71 Hub Hackathon | [Video](https://lablab.ai/event/falcon-hackathon/cyber-titans/budgie) | [Github](https://github.com/minhalmanjee/Falcon-Hackathon-Budgie-Ai-) | [Certificate](https://lablab.ai/u/@M4xash/cm0gxv92s00ac8ztm2gwf0z0a)
  * Mental Health Coach | Technologies Used: Django, Next.Js, Onrender
  * Created an Artificial Intelligence system that utilizes a finetuned model in order to serve as a coach for mental health.
  * Implemented real-time personality selection allowing users to choose their type and communicate with the coach.

* Llama 3 Hackathon |  [Video](https://lablab.ai/event/llama-3-ai-hackathon/aimers/ai-news-anylazer) | [Github](https://github.com/minhalmanjee/Llama3-News-Analyzer-) | [Certificate](https://lablab.ai/u/@M4xash/cm0fgv76z004o7hkwcdcv0zte)
  * AI News Analyzer | Technologies Used: Langchain, Llama 3, C/C++, Python
  * The tool allows users to upload an article, which it then recognizes and processes through sophisticated text recognition algorithms. 
  * We have developed two key agents within the AI News Analyzer: the News Editor and the News Analyst. 
  
Final Year Project - Natural Language Processing & Computer vision
======
* Translip - Real-time Translation & Lip Syncing | [Github](https://github.com/minhalmanjee/FYP)
  * Technologies used: OpenAI, Wav2Lip, Flask, Llama 2 | Libraries: Keras, Scikit, Tiktoken, Pytorch, Tensorflow
  * Translated English videos into Urdu language for students. Utilized OpenAI Whisper and Google Translate.
  * Implemented lip reanimation techniques to synchronize video presenters' lip movements with translated Urdu audio, using Wav2Lip and LipGan.
  * Applied NLP with Llama 2 to generate personalized explanations for technical terms in video content.
  * Bridged language gaps by integrating translation, lip reanimation, and personalization for Urdu-speaking students.
    
Item Menu Detection - Computer vision
======
* [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uipGjRlpBok5Y0af1gQBW9EwJdTJtpuY?usp=sharing) | [Report](https://github.com/minhalmanjee/Food-Detection-using-YOLO-v8/blob/main/FCV_report.pdf)
  * Technologies used: Yolov8, Roboflow, Google Colab
  * Managed and augmented datasets on Roboflow.
  * Trained Yolov8 model on the data for menu item detection.
  * Trained the model for 75 Epochs on Nvidia V100 GPU.
  * Detected menu items with high confidence values above 80%.

CICD Pipelines using Azure DevOps - Cloud Computing
======
* Technologies used: Github, Azure DevOps | [Github](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Bm4UNdjjfPo0O1DcFR-mwqBieoVtNQY8)
  * Source Code & CI: Managed code using version control system with CI pipeline and unit/automated tests.
  * CD & Release: Set up a CD pipeline with release gates and deployment rings (slow, fast, production).
  * Infrastructure & Containers: Used Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and containerization for scalable deployment.
  * Monitoring & Collaboration: Implemented using Azure DevOps for monitoring and Slack for instant notifications from dashboards.

Diabetes Prediction Using Random Forest Classifier
======
* Technologies used: Pandas, Streamlit, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Plotly | [Github](https://github.com/minhalmanjee/Diabetes-Prediction)
  * The application provides an intuitive and interactive interface where users can input relevant medical data such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and other health indicators to generate a report on their diabetes risk.
  * The application uses visual graphs to compare the user's data with the dataset, providing an educational tool to help users better understand their health status.
  * Users receive an easy-to-understand report indicating whether they are diabetic, coupled with visual feedback.

Movie Recommender System Using Knowledge Based Recommendation
======
* Technologies used: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and NLTK | [Github](https://github.com/minhalmanjee/Movie-recommendation-system)
  * This project introduces a movie recommendation system using a content-based approach. The system is designed to recommend movies similar to a given movie based on various attributes. 
  * Approach focusing on calculating cosine similarity between movies' vectors. These vectors are derived from attributes such as overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew members, ensuring a comprehensive analysis for each recommendation.
  * Streamlit library is utilized to create an intuitive frontend, allowing users to easily interact with the system and discover movie recommendations.
